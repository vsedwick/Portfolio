# Victoria Sedwick Thesis Portfolio

Welcome to my thesis portfolio, which highlights the tools, scripts, and programs I developed during my PhD. These scripts were designed to support data analysis for my research in behavioral neuroscience, with a focus on analyzing neurophysiological recordings, histological images, and motion tracking data.

The portfolio is organized into subfolders, each representing a different aspect of the research. These tools were crucial in analyzing data for my unpublished manuscript, which is currently awaiting re-submission.
## Key Features:
- Data Analysis: Scripts for analyzing [neurophysiological recordings](https://github.com/vsedwick/Portfolio/tree/master/Thesis_Research%20(python)/Photometry) and [motion tracking data](https://github.com/vsedwick/Portfolio/tree/master/Thesis_Research%20(python)/DLC-ethovision).
- Visualization: Tools for extracting and visualizing data from [public single-cell sequencing databases](https://github.com/vsedwick/Portfolio/tree/master/Thesis_Research%20(python)/AllenDatabase_andVennDiagrams).
- Statistical Analysis: Custom Python scripts for conducting [complex statistical analyses](https://github.com/vsedwick/Portfolio/tree/master/Thesis_Research%20(python)/Photometry).
- Histology: Analyzes spot counts from [in situ hybridization images](https://github.com/vsedwick/Portfolio/tree/master/Thesis_Research%20(python)/SpotCounting).

## Ongoing Development:

These programs are actively being updated to improve readability and user experience, such as the inclusion of configuration files for better customization.
