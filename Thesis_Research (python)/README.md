# Victoria Sedwick Thesis Portfolio

This portfolio showcases a collection of scripts and programs I developed during my PhD, supporting data analysis for my unpublished manuscript, currently awaiting re-submission. The scripts were instrumental in analyzing histological images, neurophysiological recordings, motion tracking, extracting and visualizing data from public single-cell sequencing databases, and conducting complex statistical analyses.

The programs are actively being updated to improve readability and user experience, including the integration of configuration files for enhanced customization. While this portfolio exclusively features Python, I have also utilized R, MATLAB, and SQL in the laboratory setting, developing scripts from scratch or adapting shared code to meet specific research needs.
