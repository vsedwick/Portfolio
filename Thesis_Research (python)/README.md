# Victoria Sedwick Thesis Portfolio

Welcome to my thesis portfolio, which highlights the tools, scripts, and programs I developed during my PhD. These scripts were designed to support data analysis for my research in behavioral neuroscience, with a focus on analyzing neurophysiological recordings, histological images, and motion tracking data.

The portfolio is organized into subfolders, each representing a different aspect of the research. These tools were crucial in analyzing data for my unpublished manuscript, which is currently awaiting re-submission.
## Key Features:
- Data Analysis: Scripts for analyzing neurophysiological recordings and motion tracking data.
- Visualization: Tools for extracting and visualizing data from public single-cell sequencing databases.
- Statistical Analysis: Custom Python scripts for conducting complex statistical analyses.
- Histology: Image processing and analysis of histological data.
