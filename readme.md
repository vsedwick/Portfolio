# Victoria Sedwick Portfolio


This portfolio includes a comprehensive collection of scripts ad programs I developed over the course of my academic career (2017-2024) as well as sample scripts to demonstrate my proficiency in a variety of programming languages and data analysis tools. Each folder contains targeted projects showcasing my expertise across different domains, including neuroscience research, statistical analysis, and general data manipulation.

## Portfolio Overview:

This repository is structured to provide examples of my capabilities in multiple programming environments, organized by language:
- Thesis (Python):
- - Scripts and tools developed during my PhD, including data analysis for neurophysiological recordings, image processing, and statistical analysis.

- SQL:
- - Queries for data manipulation and analysis, focusing on customer data and relational database management.

- MATLAB (To Be Added):

- R (To Be Added):

- SAS (To Be Added):

### Current Folders:

- Thesis Folder: Contains the complete set of Python scripts developed during my PhD. These scripts handle various tasks such as data extraction, statistical analysis, and visualization, related to my research on behavioral neuroscience.

- SQL Folder: Contains a set of queries designed to work with customer data, demonstrating my ability to manage and manipulate relational datasets. The queries range from basic data aggregation to more complex analysis using window functions and conditional logic.

## Ongoing Development:

This repository is actively evolving as I continue to add and refine scripts for MATLAB, R, and SAS. The current content represents a strong foundation of my skills, and upcoming additions will further demonstrate my versatility in data science and research environments.
