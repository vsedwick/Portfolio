# Victoria Sedwick Portfolio


This portfolio includes a comprehensive collection of scripts ad programs I developed over the course of my academic career (2017-2024) as well as sample scripts to demonstrate my proficiency in a variety of programming languages and data analysis tools. Each folder contains targeted projects showcasing my expertise across different domains, including neuroscience research, statistical analysis, and general data manipulation. I began my journey with R, followed by MATLAB, as many open-source programs in our lab used these languages. As my projects grew in complexity, I honed in on Python for its flexibility.  I also learned SQL to explore more versatile methods of database management driven by self interest.

## Portfolio Overview:

This repository is structured to provide examples of my capabilities in multiple programming environments, organized by language:
- #### [Thesis (Python)](https://github.com/vsedwick/Portfolio/tree/master/Thesis_Research%20(python)) :
    Scripts and tools developed during my PhD, including data analysis for neurophysiological recordings, image processing, animal tracking and other projects related to behavioral neuroscience. These scripts handle various tasks such as data extraction, transformation, and loading, statistical analysis, and visualization.
- #### [SQL](https://github.com/vsedwick/Portfolio/tree/master/SQL):
    Contains a set of queries designed to work with customer data, demonstrating my ability to manage and manipulate relational datasets. The queries range from basic data aggregation to more complex analysis using window functions and conditional logic.

- #### MATLAB (To Be Added):

- #### R (To Be Added):

- #### SAS (To Be Added):

## Ongoing Development:

This repository is actively evolving as I continue to add and refine scripts for MATLAB, R, and SAS. The current content represents a strong foundation of my skills, and upcoming additions will further demonstrate my versatility in data science and research environments.
